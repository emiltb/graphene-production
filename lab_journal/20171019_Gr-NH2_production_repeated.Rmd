# 20171019 Gr-NH2 production repeated {#j20171019}

This experiment is a repetition of [20170929](#j20170929), as several aspects of the experiment failed to work as expected. By a few simple modifications, it will hopefully be possible to 1) monitor diazonium concentration, and 2) obtain a proper freeze-dried product. 

## Protocol
```{r stochiometry171019}
library(units)
V = set_units(1500, mL) # Volume of 0.1 M H2SO4 to be used
C_diazo = set_units(2, mmol/L)
C_naphtol = set_units(3, mmol/L)
V_naphtol = set_units(30, mL)

M_nitro = set_units(202.64, mg/mmol) # 4-Nitrophenethylamine hydrochloride
M_nitrite = set_units(69.00, mg/mmol) # NaNO2
M_naphtol = set_units(144.17, mg/mmol) # 2-Naphtol

n_nitro = V * C_diazo
n_nitrite = n_nitro * 2
n_naphtol = V_naphtol * C_naphtol # enough to make 15 samples of 2 mL

m_nitro = n_nitro * M_nitro
m_nitrite = n_nitrite * M_nitrite
m_naphtol = n_naphtol * M_naphtol

C_dye = set_units(C_diazo * set_units(2, mL) / set_units(4, mL), mmol/L)
```

### Preparing solutions
`r format(V*0.1 / 1.0)` 1.0 M H~2~SO~4~ is diluted to `r format(V)` to produce 0.1 M H~2~SO~4~. 

The `r format(C_diazo)` 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenediazonium solution is generated *in-situ* by mixing `r format(V)` 0.1 M H~2~SO~4~ with `r format(m_nitro)` 4-Nitrophenethylamine hydrochloride (`r format(n_nitro)`) and `r format(m_nitrite)` NaNO~2~ (`r format(n_nitrite)`). This is stirred for 15 min.

A `r format(C_naphtol)` solution of 2-Naphtol is made by dissolving `r format(m_naphtol)` mg 2-Naphtol in `r format((1/5)*V_naphtol)` 10 % NaOH and `r format((4/5)*V_naphtol)` H~2~O.

Samples for UV-Vis can then be made easily by mixing 2 mL `r format(C_naphtol)` 2-Naphtol solution with 2 mL `r format(C_diazo)` diazonium-solution to obtain a solution of the azo-dye (max conc. obtained is 1 mmol/L).

### Gr-NH~2~ exfoliation
The electrochemical exfoliation of functionalised graphene will be done by positioning and 8x15 cm^2^ graphite foil between two large stainless steel electrodes and applying 10 V for 1 hour or more. Weigh the foil before electrolysis.

2 mL samples will be extracted with a syringe and put into the 2-Naphtol solution through a filter (to remove any graphite) every 20 minutes. At these points the temperature should also be noted. The samples are put in a 50 Â°C water bath for 2 minutes to facilitate reaction, before measuring the UV-Vis absorption.

The exfoliated graphene and remaining graphite foil is collected and washed several times with water and acetonitrile (mix thoroughly with water ind a separation funnel, measure pH of the filtrate). Keep most of the graphene at this point and work from here only in smaller batches to test the freeze-drying procedure.

The graphene is ultrasonicated in DMF (perhaps ca. 1 g / 100 mL) and left overnight for graphite to sediment. 

The upper 95 % of the solution is collected and centrifuged to collect most of the graphene. It is then ultrasonicated in water and freeze-dried.
