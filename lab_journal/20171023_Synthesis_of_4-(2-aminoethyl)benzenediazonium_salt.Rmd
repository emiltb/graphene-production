# 20171023 Synthesis of 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenediazonium salt {#j20171023}

I have realised, that it is necessary to perfom the synthesis of 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenediazonium salt to be able to properly control the concentration during exfoliation.

The group (and the literature in general) have many reported strategies for synthesising this compound, however the succes in the group has been varied. Several methods were found in old labbooks and in literature, and a summarised briefly [here](misc/AEBD_procedure/AEBD_procedure.html).

## Protocol: Synthesis of 4-aminoethylbenzenediazonium salt (AEBD)

The synthesis will be conducted according to the procedure from reference.[@Kowalczyk2011] To test the reaction, it will initially be conducted on 100 mg scale. 

```{r}
library(units)
M_aniline = set_units(136.19, mg/mmol)
M_nitrite = set_units(69.00, mg/mmol)
M_diazo = set_units(234.99, mg/mmol) # With BF4-ion
rho_aniline = set_units(1034, mg/mL)

m_aniline = set_units(100, mg)
n_aniline = m_aniline / M_aniline
n_nitrite = n_aniline * 1.5
m_nitrite = n_nitrite * M_nitrite

m_diazo = M_diazo * n_aniline
```

Chemicals: 4-(2-Aminoethyl)aniline ([Sigma](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/aldrich/123056?lang=en&region=DK), 97 %, `r format(M_aniline)`), Sodium nitrite (Manufacturer? `r format(M_nitrite)`), HBF~4~ (Manufacturer?, 48 % in water), diethyl ether (Manufacturer?, Grade?)

1. 0.75 mL HBF~4~ is added to 1.25 mL water and the mixture allowed to cool to 0 $^{\circ}$C.
2. Then 4-(2-aminoethyl)aniline (`r format(m_aniline, digits = 2)`, `r format(m_aniline / rho_aniline, digits = 2)`, `r format(n_aniline, digits = 2)`) is dissolved in the HBF4 solution and allowed to cool to 0 $^{\circ}$C for 15 min.
3. Sodium nitrite (`r format(m_nitrite, digits = 2)`, `r format(n_nitrite, digits = 2)`) is dissolved in 0.6 mL water and added drop by drop to the acidic amine while stirring.
4. The compounds are reacted for 40 min while keeping the mixture at 0 $^{\circ}$C.
5. A precipitate will appear in the solution and is suction filtrated and rinsed with cold diethyl ether. The salt is then dried under vacuum (without heating) and stored at -20 $^{\circ}$C.

The product can be characterised by ^1^H NMR in deuterated water.

The expected amount of 4-aminoethylbenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate is `r format(m_diazo, digits = 2)` (if yield is 100 %)
