Several groups have shown great interest in our work with production of functionalised graphene for polymer composites.

```

In this project we will attempt to produce batches for testing in various companies with various goals:

* Radisurf (Intends to do ATRP-polymerisation on the graphene and embed it in silicone).
* SP Group (Interest in testing it for their PUR products).
* Newtec (Interest in graphene with different functionalities for better interaction with their quantum dots).
* Chemical Engineers, AU (Repetition of our work in Andreas' bachelorproject for potential publication).

These projects will hopefully give some more experience in handling large quantities of graphene and give some interesting applications.
