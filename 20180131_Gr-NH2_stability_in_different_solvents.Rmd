We have spent a lot of time discussing the importance of the protonation state of the amine in Gr-NH~2~. To function in PUR-synthesis the amine should not be protonated. However, it was not something we were concerned about in Andreas' project, so it is uncertain how important this is. 

It is believed that a protonated amine should help stabilise the graphene, due to repulsive charge interactions between layers.

To test the influence of the protonation state a series of samples were made at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. The following solvents were used: 0.1 M H~2~SO~4~, demineralised water, 0.1 M NaOH, NMP and isopropanol. These were ultrasonicated for 1 hour.

The pictures below show the samples before and after ultrasonication.

```

These will be left standing for a couple of days to see the long term stability of the suspensions. 

However, after standing for two days the picture is quite different.

# Results and discussion
It seems that a deprotonation of the amine is initially beneficial to the stability of the graphene in solution, as the sample in sulphuric acid did not dissolve at all. The long term stability is probably affected by the presence of ionic species in solution, an effect that has been described by Dryfe and co-workers.[@Rodgers2015]

# Conclusion and outlook
This crude test demonstrates that there is a significant effect of changing the pH of the solvent that the graphene is suspended in. This could influence the result of the reactivity test in [20180130](20180130_Analysing_reactive_amines_on_GrNH2.html).
