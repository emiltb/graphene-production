We have spent a lot of time discussing the importance of the protonation state of the amine in Gr-NH~2~. To function in PUR-synthesis the amine should not be protonated. However, it was not something we were concerned about in Andreas' project, so it is uncertain how important this is. 

It is believed that a protonated amine should help stabilise the graphene, due to repulsive charge interactions between layers.

# Journal

To test the influence of the protonation state a series of samples were made at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. The following solvents were used: 0.1 M H~2~SO~4~, demineralised water, 0.1 M NaOH, NMP and isopropanol. These were ultrasonicated for 1 hour.

The pictures below show the samples before and after ultrasonication.

```

These will be left standing for a couple of days to see the long term stability of the suspensions.
