title: "20170915 Azo-coupling of diazonium compounds"
---
  
```{r, child="_setup.Rmd"}
```

In the production of functionalised graphene it would be nice to assess that the diazonium compound is continously present. This was previously attempted using [electrochemistry](#j20170904), but was not succesful due to very low concentrations.

Another possibility is to use the diazonium compound to make an azo-coupling with 2-Naphtol. This should produce a very colorful dye, which should be easy to measure concentration of using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy.

```{r}

```


# Protocol
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(units)
V = set_units(10, mL) # Volume of 0.1 M H2SO4 to be used
C_diazo = set_units(2, mmol/L)

M_nitro = set_units(202.64, mg/mmol) # 4-Nitrophenethylamine hydrochloride
M_nitrite = set_units(69.00, mg/mmol) # NaNO2
M_naphtol = set_units(144.17, mg/mmol) # 2-Naphtol

n_nitro = V * C_diazo
n_nitrite = n_nitro * 1.5
n_naphtol = n_nitro * 1.5

m_nitro = n_nitro * M_nitro
m_nitrite = n_nitrite * M_nitrite
m_naphtol = n_naphtol * M_naphtol

C_dye = set_units(C_diazo * set_units(2, mL) / set_units(4, mL), mmol/L)
```

Initially the diazonium compound is formed by mixing `r format(V)` 0.1 M H~2~SO~4~ with `r format(m_nitro)` 4-Nitrophenethylamine hydrochloride (`r format(n_nitro)`) and `r format(m_nitrite)` NaNO~2~ (`r format(n_nitrite)`). This is stirred for 15 min.
The 2-Naphtol solution is made by mixing `r format(m_naphtol)` 2-Napthol (`r format(n_naphtol)`) in 2 mL 10 % sodium hydroxide and 8 mL water

2 mL of the diazonium-solution is then added to 2 mL of the 2-Naphtol solution. This should form an orange-red dye upon heating. The final concentration of the dye is `r format(C_dye)`.

# Journal
The experiment was performed as described and upon mixing of the diazonium-compound and 2-Naphtol a red-orange solution formed immediately. This was heated using hot water for 5 min before measuring the absorption spectra.

# Results and discussion
UV-Vis absorption spectra were acquired between 200 and 800 nm. The data is first loaded into R.
```{r}
path <- "data/raw_data/uvvis/20170915 Azodye/"
data170915 <- tibble(file = list.files(path = path, pattern = "*.csv")) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(paste0(path,file), read_delim, delim = ";", skip = 1)) %>%
  mutate(name = stringr::str_extract(file, pattern = "^[\\sa-zA-Z0-9_-]*")) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  mutate(region = ifelse(nm > 400, "Visible", "UV"))

```

We can plot each absorption spectrum. From this we can see that, as expected, all compounds adsorb light in the ultraviolet region, but it is only the synthesized azo-dye that has any significant adsorption in the visible range. 

```{r}
data170915 %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("2-Naphtol", "Azo-dye 1-0", "Diazo")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(nm, A, color = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~region, ncol = 2, scales = "free")

ggsave("figs/20170904_UVVis_compounds.png", width = 16, height = 6, units = "cm", dpi = 300)
```

Data has also been obtained for a series of dilutions of the azo-dye to make a calibration curve. The numbers in the legend indicate the dilution factor (i.e 1 to 0, 1 to 2 etc.)

```{r}
data170915 %>% 
  filter(stringr::str_detect(name, "^(Azo)")) %>% 
  mutate(name = forcats::fct_reorder(name, A, .desc = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(nm, A, color = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~region, ncol = 2, scales = "free")
```

The peak at 499 nm is used to make a calibration curve and to calculate an extinction coefficient for the azo-dye.


```{r}
data170915_cal <- data170915 %>% 
  filter(stringr::str_detect(name, "^(Azo)"), nm == 499) %>% 
  mutate(dilution = stringr::str_extract(name, "\\d-[\\d]+")) %>% 
  separate(dilution, c("start", "dilution"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(C = start / (dilution+start)) 

# Fit a linear model to the data
fit170915 <- lm(A ~ C, data = data170915_cal)

new_C <- tibble(C = seq(0, 1, 0.1))
fitted170915 <- cbind(new_C, predict(fit170915, interval = "confidence", newdata = new_C))

data170915_cal %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(C, A)) +
  geom_line(data = fitted170915, aes(C, fit)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = fitted170915, aes(x = C, ymin = lwr, ymax = upr), alpha = 0.2) + 
  labs(title = "Absorption of azo-dye at 499 nm", x = "Concentration (mmol/L)", y = "Absorption (a.u.)")

ggsave("figs/20170904_UVVis_dilution.png", width = 16, height = 4, units = "cm", dpi = 300)
```

The absorption coefficient at 499 nm becomes `r round(coef(fit170915)[2], 3)` Â± `r round(confint(fit170915, parm = "C", level = 0.95)[2] - coef(fit170915)[2], 3)` mM^-1^ cm^-1^. Note that this is for the azo-dye, and the concentration of the diazonium is halved during the production of the dye. In reality, relative concentrations within a single experiment are probably most interesting. 

# Conclusion and outlook
Based on this experiment it should be possible to easily monitor the concentration of diazonium salt during exfoliation of graphite. 2 mL samples of the exfoliation solution can be extracted at regular intervals, filtered for graphite and then injected directly into a solution of sodium naphthalen-2-olate. From this the adsorption spectrum will directly tell to what degree the diazonium compound has degraded.
