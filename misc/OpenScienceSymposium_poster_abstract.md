# Open Lab Journal using RMarkdown: Graphene production and functionalisation

To make an open science project as accessible and useful as possible to the public, all scientific work being done must be available. It is easy for a scientist to document lab procedures in a manner for other people to follow. However, for a truly reproducible workflow all data analysis should also be made available. This can be done in a traditional way by sharing i.e. Excel or Origin spreadsheets. It is, however, difficult to discern the thought process of the scientist from a spreadsheet - this is much more clearly laid out by more modern methods such as an R script for analysis.

The SPOMAN project "Graphene production and functionalisation" is documented entirely using RMarkdown. This makes it possible to create a dynamic lab journal where procedures, data analysis and results are kept in one single document for easy presentation and collaboration.
