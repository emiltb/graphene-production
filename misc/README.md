# Project description: Electrochemical production of functionalised graphene for polymer composites
## Summary of preliminary work:
In previous work ([see osf.io/zh8b2/](https://osf.io/zh8b2/)) graphene was electrochemically exfoliated and functionalised with aryldiazonium compounds. Good results were obtained by producing graphene functionalised with the amine diazonium salt, see figure below. This functionalised graphene was then incorporated into polyurethane (PUR) to increase the mechanical properties of the hybrid material. In the preliminary results the increase in mechanical properties is 44 % in elastic modulus (Youngâ€™s modulus) and 35 % in ultimate tensile strength (UTS) at just 0.1 wt% of graphene added to the material.
The graphene is exfoliated and functionalised in a one pot process in an oxidative environment. This harsh environment damages the graphene but also makes it easier to work with and scale to increase batch sizes.

## Scope of new project
This project will reproduce the previous results and extend upon the work to prepare it for publication. Overall, what we believe is needed to prepare a paper on this work is:

* A larger number of PUR/graphene samples must be fabricated and tested to increase the statistical significance of the experiment (18 per batch, compared to 6 in the preliminary study).
* Control experiments with other functionalised graphene samples are necessary to prove that the cross-linking from the amine-group is important.

### Functional groups to test
As seen in the figure above, we intend to test four different diazonium salts for graphene functionalisation and compare their behaviour as a filler in PUR.

1. **D-NH<sub>2</sub>**: The amine-group can directly crosslink to the PUR matrix and increase the mechanical strength of the PUR. This will be tested first to show the reproducibility of the preliminary study.
2. **D-OH**: A diazonium compound with an alcohol group instead of the amine is used in functionalisation. The OH-group should also be reactive and crosslink with PUR, but less than the amine. This should therefore show an improvement in mechanical properties of the material but not as much as the amine-functionalised graphene.
3. **D-CH<sub>3</sub>**: Graphene functionalised with a simpler diazonium compound, such as one with just a methyl group, will also be made to further see how much of an impact the functional group actually has. Instead of the methyl, a diazonium salt with a propyl group or even just the benzene without additional functionality might be used.
4. **D-NO<sub>2</sub>**: To broaden the catalogue of different functional groups in these polyurethane/graphene hybrid materials a nitro group will also be used. This group is not expected to have an impact on the properties of the material so this will also serve as another test of whether the amine is actually the group that increases the properties of the hybrid material.
5. As a control, graphene produced without any diazonium compound present will also be used.

All graphene types are characterised (Raman spectroscopy, XPS, TEM) and the polyurethane/graphene hybrid material is made in 3 different batches for each type of graphene with approximately 18 dog bones each. These are tested for increase in mechanical properties as a  start, but can also be tested for electrical properties. In total 5 different types of graphene are produced, characterised and incorporated into a polyurethane/graphene hybrid material.
