  abstract = {Since the beginning of the 'graphene era' post-2004, there has been significant interest in developing a high purity, high yield, and scalable fabrication route toward graphene materials for both primary research purposes and industrial production. One suitable approach to graphene production lies in the realm of electrochemical exfoliation, in which a potential difference is applied between a graphite anode/cathode in the presence of an electrolyte-containing medium. Herein we review various works on the electrochemical fabrication of graphene materials specifically through the use of electrochemical intercalation and exfoliation of a graphite source electrode, focusing on the quality and purity of products formed. We categorise the most significant works in terms of anodic and cathodic control, highlighting the merits of the respective approaches, as well as indicating the challenges associated with both procedures.},

  abstract = {Graphene-based membranes demonstrating ultrafast water transport, precise molecular sieving of gas and solvated molecules shows great promise as novel separation platforms; however, scale-up of these membranes to large-areas remains an unresolved problem. Here we demonstrate that the discotic nematic phase of graphene oxide (GO) can be shear aligned to form highly ordered, continuous, thin films of multi-layered GO on a support membrane by an industrially adaptable method to produce large-area membranes (13 [times] 14[thinsp]cm2) in <5[thinsp]s. Pressure driven transport data demonstrate high retention (>90%) for charged and uncharged organic probe molecules with a hydrated radius above 5[thinsp]A as well as modest (30-40%) retention of monovalent and divalent salts. The highly ordered graphene sheets in the plane of the membrane make organized channels and enhance the permeability (71[plusmn]5[thinsp]l[thinsp]m-2[thinsp]hr-1[thinsp]bar-1 for 150[plusmn]15[thinsp]nm thick membranes).},

The films thus deposited on glassy carbon surfaces require mechanical abrasion to be removed. Cyclic voltammetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, polarization modulation IR reflection absorption spectroscopy, Auger spectroscopy, and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy allow the characterization of the overlayer and an estimate of the surface coverage. The latter can be controlled through diazonium concentration and electrolysis duration. The mechanism of derivatization is discussed on the basis of the kinetic data obtained from cyclic voltammetry and preparative electrolysis. This versatile method of surface modification may find applications in the field of carbon−epoxy composites as attested by the successful binding of grafted p-aminophenyl groups with epichlorhydrin.},

This definition can be extended to reactions involving an electron transfer between the substrate to be modified and the reagent, but also to examples where a reducing or oxidizing reagent is added to produce the reactive species. These methods are interesting as they provide a real bond between the surface and the organic layer. Electrografting applies to a variety of substrates including carbon, metals and their oxides, but also dielectrics such as polymers. Since the 1980s several methods have been developed, either by reduction or oxidation, and some of them have reached an industrial stage. This critical review describes the methods that are used for electrografting, their mechanism, the formation and growth of the layers as well as their applications (742 references).},

Thus, a given ratio could correspond to two different defect densities, above or below the maximum. The analysis of the G peak width and its dispersion with excitation energy solves this ambiguity.},

R4N+ cations with varying alkyl chain lengths (methyl, ethyl and butyl) have been shown to exhibit excellent charge recovery effects during charge/discharge studies.

Groups such as 4-carboxyphenyl, 4-nitrophenyl, 4-diethylaniline (DEA), and 4-bromophenyl were grafted at a glassy carbon electrode surface. The stability of these grafted groups, present at the glassy carbon electrode surface, was studied at various electrode potentials in aqueous media. In appropriate experimental conditions, the as-grafted groups severely inhibit the cyclic voltammetry response of selected redox probes. Thus, the reappearance and/or increase of an electrochemical response, after polarization, was taken as an indication that a modification of the grafted layer occurred. Our results demonstrated that polarization at very positive (ca. 1.8 V) and negative (ca. −2 V) potentials is needed to observe an electrochemical response. Electrochemical impedance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies were also used to investigate the stability of the grafted layers. The impedance data usually tracks fairly well the cyclic voltammetry results, although the former appears to be more sensitive to changes that are occurring upon polarization of the modified electrode. Interestingly, the XPS data indicate clearly that the grafted layer is not always completely removed at the extreme positive and negative potentials investigated. A mechanism was proposed to explain the transformation occurring during polarization of the modified electrode and involves desorption of the substituted aryl groups during the concomitant hydrogen, oxygen, or chlorine evolution and finally leaving close to a covalently bonded monolayer of the grafted species at the electrode surface.},

The cell contains one or more planar Al wafers in contact with an electrolyte solution, which is subjected to an external electric field parallel to the surfaces of the wafers. Beyond a certain threshold value of the magnitude of the field, the current through the cell increases more than proportionally with the field strength. This is due to faradaic processes occurring at the two ends of the conducting substrates, i.e. reduction at the positive side of the electric field in the solution and oxidation at the negative side. In the case of Al wafers, anodic dissolution of the metal takes place and the progression of the ‘corroding’ edge can be followed visually. The overall electrolytic process, corresponding with the distributed current along the surface of the wafer, could be explained and modeled on the basis of the conventionally measured Butler-Volmer characteristics of the monopolar Al electrode.},

  abstract = {A pulse radiolysis study of six parasubstituted benzenediazonium salts, X−C6H4N2+ [X = COOC2H5, F, H, CH3, OCH3, and N(CH3)2], has been carried out in neutral aqueous solutions, where the principal reductant is the solvated electron. In the first step, the solvated electron reduces the diazonium salts to the corresponding diazenyl radicals, X−C6H4N2•, in a diffusion-controlled process. On a short time scale, X−C6H4N2• is either involved in an equilibrium reaction with the parent diazonium salt (K > 100 M-1) in which a (X−C6H4)2N4•+ adduct is formed or decays to the aryl radical, X−C6H4•, through the expulsion of dinitrogen. Simulation of this kinetic scheme allows us to make a rough determination of the rate constants involved. The rate constants for the formation of the adducts are in the range (0.7−1.9) × 107 M-1 s-1, whereas the fragmentation rate constants are in the range (0.4−4.0) × 105 s-1. The aryl radicals subsequently attack the diazonium salts mainly at the terminal nitrogen atom with rate constants of (0.13−5.9) × 107 M-1 s-1, thereby forming the radical cations of the corresponding azobenzenes, (X−C6H4)2N2•+, or eventually the corresponding OH adducts, (X−C6H4)2N2OH•, upon further reaction with water. These intermediates were identified in pulse radiolysis by generating the very same species through an alternative pathway involving oxidation of the parent azobenzenes. The reaction between the aryl radical and the salt exhibits a clear substituent effect in the sense that the reactivity increases as the electron-donating power of the substituent is enhanced. This is attributed to the stabilizing effect exerted by electron-donating groups on radical cations. Thus, the radical cations can be detected only for the methoxy and dimethylamino groups, whereas for the other substituents the transformation of (X−C6H4)2N2•+ to (X−C6H4)2N2OH• takes place instantaneously.},

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is able to probe disorder in graphene through defect-activated peaks. It is of great interest to link these features to the nature of disorder. Here we present a detailed analysis of the Raman spectra of graphene containing different type of defects. We found that the intensity ratio of the D and D′ peak is maximum (∼13) for sp3-defects, it decreases for vacancy-like defects (∼7), and it reaches a minimum for boundaries in graphite (∼3.5). This makes Raman Spectroscopy a powerful tool to fully characterize graphene.},

The anchoring of PVA\ chains on GO\ sheets was confirmed by XPS\ and FTIR\ measurements. The resulting functionalized sample became soluble in formic acid, allowing solution-phase processing for preparation of PA6/GO composites. Answering to the efficient polymer-chain grafting, a homogeneously dispersion of GO\ sheets in PA6\ matrix and a dramatic improvement of interface adhesion between nanosheets and matrix were observed in PA6/GO-es-PVA composites by SEM\ and TEM. The depressed crystallization of PA6\ chains in PA6/GO-es-PVA composites was investigated by their DSC\ and XRD\ results.},

The goal is to find components that are maximally independent and non-Gaussian (non-normal). Its fundamental difference to classical multi-variate statistical methods is in the assumption of non-Gaussianity, which enables the identification of original, underlying components, in contrast to classical methods. The basic theory of independent component analysis was mainly developed in the 1990s and summarized, for example, in our monograph in 2001. Here, we provide an overview of some recent developments in the theory since the year 2000. The main topics are: analysis of causal relations, testing independent components, analysing multiple datasets (three-way data), modelling dependencies between the components and improved methods for estimating the basic model.},

Thus, at a nanofiller load as low as 0.07 wt%, the novel materials presented an increase in the elastic modulus higher than 10% and an enhancement in the tensile strength of more than 40% compared to pristine PET. The improvements in the tensile strength were directly correlated to changes in elongation at break and indirectly correlated to the fracture initiation area. The enhancements observed in the mechanical properties of polymer/graphene nanocomposites achieved at low exfoliated graphene loadings and manufactured exclusively via melt mixing may open the door to industrial manufacturing of economical novel materials with superior stiffness, strength and ductility.},

Thus, at a nanofiller load as low as 0.07 wt%, the novel materials presented an increase in the elastic modulus higher than 10% and an enhancement in the tensile strength of more than 40% compared to pristine PET. The improvements in the tensile strength were directly correlated to changes in elongation at break and indirectly correlated to the fracture initiation area. The enhancements observed in the mechanical properties of polymer/graphene nanocomposites achieved at low exfoliated graphene loadings and manufactured exclusively via melt mixing may open the door to industrial manufacturing of economical novel materials with superior stiffness, strength and ductility.},

  abstract = {High-quality growth of graphene and subsequent reliable transfer to insulating substrates are needed for various technological applications, such as flexible screens and high speed electronics. In this paper, we present a new electrochemical method for the transfer of large-area, high-quality single crystalline graphene from Ir(1 1 1) to Si/SiO 2 under ambient conditions. The method is based on intercalation of tetraoctylammonium ions between the graphene layer and the Ir surface. This simple technique allows transfer of graphene single crystals having the same size as the substrate they are grown on (diameter ≈7 mm). In addition, the substrate can be reused for further growth cycles. A detailed Raman map analysis of the transferred graphene reveals straight lines, in which the Raman peaks characteristic for graphene are shifted. These lines originate from scratches in the Ir(1 1 1) crystal introduced by the polishing procedure. Furthermore, areas with numerous wrinkles exist inbetween these lines, forming a network across the entire graphene crystal. Hence, the initial characteristics and imprints left on the sheet of graphene in terms of strain and wrinkles from the growth process remain after transfer.},

  abstract = {Development of versatile methods for graphene functionalization is necessary before use in applications such as composites or as catalyst support. In this study, bipolar electrochemistry is used as a wireless functionalization method to graft 4-bromobenzenediazonium on large (10 x 10 mm(2)) monolayer graphene sheets supported on SiO2. Using this technique, transferred graphene can be electrochemically functionalized without the need of a metal support or the deposition of physical contacts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy are used to map the chemical changes and modifications of graphene across the individual sheets. Interestingly, the defect density is similar between samples, independent of driving potential, whereas the grafting density is increased upon increasing the driving potential. It is observed that the 2D nature of the electrode influences the electrochemistry and stability of the electrode compared to conventional electrografting using a three-electrode setup. On one side, the graphene will be blocked by the attached organic film, but the conductivity is also altered upon functionalization, which makes the graphene electrode different from a normal metal electrode. Furthermore, it is shown that it is possible to simultaneously modify an array of many small graphene electrodes (1 x 1 mm(2)) on SiO2.},

In this study aryl diazonium, iodonium, and sulfonium salts are reductively grafted onto gold surfaces using an excess of hydroquinone to set the anode at a fixed potential. In general, aryl diazonium salts are easier to reduce than the corresponding iodonium salts which, again, are more easily reduced than sulfonium salts. For all three salts grafting is observed at the reductive site of the bipolar electrode, but with distinctly different features due to the different reduction potentials required to facilitate the grafting. Depending on the reduction potentials of the salts relative to that of the grafting agent, that is, the aryl radical, it is possible to create movable band-like grafted areas by diazonium grafting, expanding bands by iodonium grafting, or optically invisible thin bands by sulfonium grafting. From these findings, a relationship between the grafting behavior and the applied potential difference is deduced.},

The approach is based on the use of an organic bifunctional molecule, which may be oxidatively and reductively electrografted at the same time. The reduction process goes through the diazonium group, while the oxidation proceeds via the primary amine. The double functionalized plates are investigated by ellipsometry, cyclic voltammetry, condensation imaging, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Post-modification of one of the anchoring layers illustrates the versatility of the system, pointing to its potential use in fields going from molecular electronics to targeted drug delivery.},

  abstract = {Functionalization and dispersion of graphene sheets are of crucial importance for their end applications. Chemical functionalization of graphene enables this material to be processed by solvent-assisted techniques, such as layer-by-layer assembly, spin-coating, and filtration. It also prevents the agglomeration of single layer graphene during reduction and maintains the inherent properties of graphene. Therefore, a detailed review on the advances of chemical functionalization of graphene is presented. Synthesis and characterization of graphene have also been reviewed in the current article. The functionalization of graphene can be performed by covalent and noncovalent modification techniques. In both cases, surface modification of graphene oxide followed by reduction has been carried out to obtain functionalized graphene. It has been found that both the covalent and noncovalent modification techniques are very effective in the preparation of processable graphene. However, the electrical conductivity of the functionalized graphene has been observed to decrease significantly compared to pure graphene. Moreover, the surface area of the functionalized graphene prepared by covalent and non-covalent techniques decreases significantly due to the destructive chemical oxidation of flake graphite followed by sonication, functionalization and chemical reduction. In order to overcome these problems, several studies have been reported on the preparation of functionalized graphene directly from graphite (one-step process). In all these cases, surface modification of graphene can prevent agglomeration and facilitates the formation of stable dispersions. Surface modified graphene can be used for the fabrication of polymer nanocomposites, super-capacitor devices, drug delivery system, solar cells, memory devices, transistor device, biosensor, etc.},

  abstract = {Electrografting using aryldiazonium salts provides a fast and efficient technique to functionalize commercially available 3−5 layered graphene (vapour-deposited) on nickel. In this study, Raman spectroscopy is used to quantify the grafting efficiency of cyclic voltammetry which is one of the most versatile, yet simple, electrochemical techniques available. To a large extent the number of defects/substituents introduced to the basal plane of high-quality graphene by this procedure can be controlled through the sweeping conditions employed. After extended electrografting the defect density reaches a saturation level (∼1013 cm−2) which is independent of the quality of the graphene expressed through its initial content of defects. However, it is reached within fewer voltammetric cycles for low-quality graphene. Based on these results it is suggested that the grafting occurs (a) directly at defect sites for, in particular, low-quality graphene, (b) directly at the basal plane for, in particular, high-quality graphene, and/or (c) at already grafted molecules to give a mushroom-like film growth for all films. Moreover, it is shown that a tertiary alkyl bromide can be introduced at a given surface density to serve as radical initiator for surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). Brushes of poly(methyl methacrylate) are grown from these substrates, and the relationship between polymer thickness and sweeping conditions is studied.},

  abstract = {Graphene sheets were spontaneously functionalized with anthraquinone molecules in a one-pot process, during the oxidative electrochemical exfoliation of a graphite electrode in a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution containing anthraquinone diazonium ions. This counterintuitive process involves the electrochemical oxidation of graphite and reduction of diazonium ions and functionalization occurs by spontaneous reaction of freshly generated graphene sheets with diazonium ions. This reaction is faster than the common approach based on the reaction of diazonium ions with pre-exfoliated graphene sheets. Indeed, the grafting yield of our one-pot process is higher than that of a two-step procedure based on functionalization of already produced graphene sheets, presumably due to the higher reactivity of freshly generated graphene sheets during electrochemical exfoliation. As a result of functionalization, the water dispersibility of graphene sheets was improved and an increase of the BET specific surface area was observed. The presence of anthraquinone molecules was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Thermogravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscopy and electronic conductivity measurements are consistent with the covalent bonding of anthraquinone on the graphene sheets. Thermogravimetric analysis and cyclic voltammetry data allowed the evaluation of the loading of anthraquinone groups on the graphene sheets.},

Here we show that high-shear mixing of graphite in suitable stabilizing liquids results in large-scale exfoliation to give dispersions of graphene nanosheets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy show the exfoliated flakes to be unoxidized and free of basal-plane defects. We have developed a simple model that shows exfoliation to occur once the local shear rate exceeds 104 s−1. By fully characterizing the scaling behaviour of the graphene production rate, we show that exfoliation can be achieved in liquid volumes from hundreds of millilitres up to hundreds of litres and beyond. The graphene produced by this method performs well in applications from composites to conductive coatings. This method can be applied to exfoliate BN, MoS2 and a range of other layered crystals.},

Understanding the mechanisms governing the stability of these dispersions is therefore of both scientific interest and technological importance. Herein, we have used addition of an indifferent electrolyte to perturb few-layer graphene dispersions in a nonaqueous solvent (1,2-dichloroethane) as a way to probe the importance of interparticle electrostatic repulsions toward the overall dispersion stability. At a sufficient electrolyte concentration, complete sedimentation of the dispersions occurred over 24 h, and the relationship between dispersed graphene concentration and electrolyte concentration was consistent with a dispersion stabilized by electrostatic repulsions. We also found that an increased oxygen content in the graphite starting material produced dispersions of greater stability, indicating that the extent of oxidation is an important parameter in determining the extent of electrostatic stabilization in nonaqueous graphene dispersions.},

We have developed a thermogravimetric-spectroscopy-based approach to accurately determine the dispersant-assisted CNT (or nanoparticles, in general) concentration in dispersion. A thermogravimetric analysis of the filtered and washed precipitate, that is usually discarded after centrifugation, is used here to accurately calculate the CNT mass in the precipitate and (through mass-balance) its mass in the supernatant. Once the true CNT concentration has been determined, a conventional spectroscopy-based concentration calibration plot is constructed for simple and swift use in further concentration measurements. Such true concentration analysis is crucial for studying the concentration-property relationship.},

The glass transition temperature of PP\ is enhanced by ∼2.5 °C by incorporating only 0.041 vol% graphene. The thermal oxidative stability of PP\ is also remarkably improved with the addition of graphene, for example, compared with neat PP, the initial degradation temperature is enhanced by 26 °C at only 0.42 vol% of graphene loading.},

  abstract = {The applicability and versatility of the recently communicated procedure for the grafting of conducting carbon substrates by diaryliodonium salts is expanded. We have found that several types of organic arylic layers can be formed on the carbon surface and that the chemical functionalities of the thus formed layers can be varied extensively over electron withdrawing (for example, −NO2) to electron donating (for example, −OMe) groups. A comparative study involving the grafting of aryldiazonium salts reveals that, despite the two approaches being similar, iodonium salts exhibit spontaneous grafting to a significantly lower extent. Nevertheless, the grafted layer becomes less accessible to proton transport as visualized from a greater reluctance toward the reduction of surface-confined nitro groups to amino groups in acidic medium. Employment of unsymmetrical iodonium salts opens up the interesting possibility of forming organic films consisting of a mixture of two different aryl groups. Alternatively, such composite layers may be prepared by selecting iodonium and diazonium salts with comparable reduction properties. Analysis of the surfaces is carried out by means of cyclic voltammetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ToF-SIMS (time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry). The ToF-SIMS analysis primarily serves to provide unambiguous evidence for the covalent attachment of the organic layers to the surface.},

The measured value, 0.37[plusmn]0.01[thinsp]J[thinsp]m-2 for the incommensurate state of bicrystal graphite, is nearly invariant with respect to temperature (22[thinsp][deg]C[le]T[le]198[thinsp][deg]C) and bicrystal twist angle, and insensitive to impurities from the atmosphere. The CE for the ideal ABAB graphite stacking, 0.39[plusmn]0.02[thinsp]J[thinsp]m-2, is calculated based on a combination of the measured CE and a theoretical calculation. These experimental measurements are also ideal for use in evaluating the efficacy of competing theoretical approaches.},

The electrochemically delaminated graphene films are continuous over 95% of the surface and exhibit increasingly better electronic quality after several growth cycles on the reused copper catalyst, due to the suppression of quasi-periodical nanoripples induced by copper step edges. The electrochemical delamination process affords the advantages of high efficiency, low-cost recyclability, and minimal use of etching chemicals.},

  abstract = {Self-assembly of chemically modified graphenes (CMGs), including graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and their derivatives, has emerged as one of the most appealing strategies to develop unprecedented graphene-based functional materials. With the assistance of various non-covalent forces such as hydrogen bonding, ionic, amphiphilic and [small pi]-[small pi] interactions, CMGs decorated with multiple functional groups are favorable for assembly with different organic and inorganic components which can result in hierarchical composites possessing unique structures and functions. In this review, we will summarize the state-of-the-art self-assembly strategies that have been established to construct CMG based nanomaterials, including nanoparticles, nanospheres, nanofibers, nanorods, nanosheets, and macroscopic thin films, fibers and porous networks. The driving forces involved in the self-assembly process will be elucidated in the context. Further, we will also highlight several representative examples of applications regarding the self-assembled CMG based materials.},

  abstract = {We reported an efficient method to prepare nylon-6− (PA6−) graphene (NG) composites by in situ polymerization of caprolactam in the presence of graphene oxide (GO). During the polycondensation, GO was thermally reduced to graphene simultaneously. By adjusting the feed ratio of caprolactam to GO, various composites with 0.01−10 wt % content of graphene were obtained. The highly grafting nylon-6 arms on graphene sheets was confirmed by XPS, FTIR, TGA and AFM measurements, showing the grafting content up to 78 wt % and homogeneous 2D brush-like morphology from AFM observations. The efficient polymer-chain grafting makes the graphene homogeneously dispersed in PA6 matrix and depresses the crystallization of PA6 chains. Furthermore, we prepared NG fibers by melt spinning process, and found that the tensile strength increased by 2.1 folds and Young’s modulus increased by 2.4 folds with the graphene loading of 0.1 wt % only, revealing an excellent reinforcement to composites by graphene. The in situ condensation polymerization approach paves the way to prepare graphene-based nanocomposites of condensation polymers with high performances and novel functionalities.},

The nanoparticles were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infra spectrum (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test. The results showed that the particles’ size was determined by the dripping rate and that PVP molecules played the role of preventing the aggregation and restricting the size of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles with diameter from 6.5 to 1.9 nm obviously exhibited negative contrast enhancement and concentrated at the target area guided by a permanent magnet.},

  abstract        = {Knowledge of the dimensional changes occurring during electrochemical processes is fundamental for understanding of the electrochemical intercalation/insertion mechanism and for evaluation of potential application in electrochemical devices. We studied a highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) electrode in perchloric acid, as a model to elucidate the mechanism of electrochemical anion intercalation in graphite. The aim of the work is the local and time dependent investigation of dimensional changes of the host material during electrochemical intercalation processes on the nanometer scale. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM), combined with cyclic voltammetry, as the in situ tool of analysis during intercalation and deintercalation of perchlorate anions. According to the AFM measurements, the HOPG interlayer spacing increases by 32{\%} in agreement with the formation of stage IV of graphite intercalation compounds, when perchlorate anions intercalate. In addition, the local aspect of the process has been demonstrated by revealing coexisting regions with different kinetics for intercalation and deintercalation processes.},
